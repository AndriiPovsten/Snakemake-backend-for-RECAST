# Snakemake backend for RECAST
This is a small "Hello World!" example which will give you a brief understanding of [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) usage for running your workflows.

We provide 2 options, one you can run locally, the other - using a REANA client.

Instruction for running "Hello World" example locally you can find in the `recast_helloworld` directory in `RECAST-instructions.md` file.

For running this example using REANA-client please have a look at `REANA-client_instruction.md` file in the `reana_helloworld` directory.
